## Bike Geometry Calculator

My basic idea here is to calculate your main geometry data for a new bike project with only the innner leg length.
Its working fine so far. You can see the calculations at the ergo_calculator page.

When you hit calculate your data is send to mongoDB and a new bike card is created on the collections page.

Now you can see your informations when you click on the tool that redirects you to the details page.
Here you can leave comments on your new project.
And you can google for some parts that could fit to your personal bike geometry.

have fun-
