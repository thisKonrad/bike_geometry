      <h3>Measure your Inner Leg Length</h3>
      To measure your inside leg, stand with your legs approximately shoulder
      width apart with your shoes off, 
      then measure from the ground up into your groin. 
      You can also use a pencil to mark your inside leg on a wall and measure it later.
